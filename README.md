This is a repository to share Stanford Social Learning Lab's online testing procedure and materials. 
These materials are developed by members of the Social Learning Lab (PI: Hyowon Gweon). We are particularly grateful to our students/post-docs (Mika Asaba, Sophie Bridgers, Griffin Dietz, Yang Wu, and Natalia VÃ©lez) and lab staff who played critical roles (Brandon Carrillo, Megan Merrick, Jessa Stegall, and Xijia Zhou. 

Materials in this repository are licensed (CC-BY-NC); what this means is that you are free to modify or revise the materials as you see fit for your lab, as long as you credit the original source in any resulting publications. To cite our materials, you can use this DOI: [insert]. e.g., [APA citation].

Some caveats: the procedure and materials developed here are suitable for labs who plan to run scheduled video chats using Zoom & video-recording in your studies. The goal is to recreate the in-person testing experience as much as possible. If you want your studies to be available for participation at anytime, you can check Lookit, Panda, etc.

Recently, we launched [ChildrenHelpingScience.com](https://childrenhelpingscience.com/), a collective effort to test children online from around the world. Please join us!


## How our online testing works:

To see an example video for how we conduct a study online, you can check [here]. The complete slides we use (including calibration slides, parental consent, and feedback slides, except for specific study slides) can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/Example/Standardized_Slides_Sharing.key).

For the entire work flow, the content below is organized chronologically: preparations before the test day, during the test day, and after the test day. Each item has a link from which you can download the raw materials we use in our testing. All materials are provided with their raw format whenever possible, such as the keynote file, for your convenience to edit and reuse in your studies. Feel free to rearrange each component suitable for your study. We will update all materials individually when there is a new version.

If you still have questions about any of the steps or materials, or if the link isn't working, you can reach us at: [insert email].

For people who aren't familiar with Github, to download the material, you can click 'Download' on the top right of each meterial's page. <br>

### A. Before the test day:
  1. Lab IRB. 
  2. Set up Zoom: <br>
    a) Researcher Instruction Guide. (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/Before_test_day/Lab%20Testing%20Online%20Prep%20Guide.key)) <br>
    b) Use a consistent virtual background. (Example [here](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/Before_test_day/virtual_background.jpg))
  3. Recruiting parents: <br>
    a) Recruitement Poster. (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/Before_test_day/SLL%20Participation%20Flyer.pdf)) <br>
    b) Email templates.   
    c) Parent Instruction guide. (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/Before_test_day/parent_instruction_guide.key)) 
  3. 

### B. On the test day: 
  1. Rapport with children; Introduce the study to parents (like in-person testing).
  2. Lab standardized calibration slides & sound check (with a short video clip of your choice). (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/On_test_day/Calibration_Part1.key))
  3. Parental Consent. (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/On_test_day/Parental_Consent.key))
  4. Study specific video screen calibration slide (researchers can self-adjust). (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/On_test_day/Calibration_Part2.key))
  5. Children Assent + study slides (like in-person testing).
  6. Feedback slides for testing. (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/On_test_day/Feedback_Slides.key))
     (You can also use this shortened version). (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/On_test_day/Shortened_Follow_Up.key))

### C. After the test day:
  1. Certificates for children. (See [ours](https://github.com/sociallearninglab/online_testing_materials/blob/master/After_test_day/Online%20Testing%20Certificate.pdf))
  2. Data log-in.
